	Thaumaturgy is the art of bending reality via the employment of signs and icons in a precise and predetermined manner. It is most commonly associated with rituals, summoning circles and prayer groups, though that is only a small fraction of the whole thaumaturgical portfolio.
Contrary to popular assumption, thaumaturgy does not necessarily require physical materials to activate. Successful thaumaturgical masters are known for working with a variety of signs and patterns, ranging from simple blood symbols to the distribution of music preferences inside a given age group.
Thaumaturgy is considered to be a relatively accessible form of magic, especially the ancient and forbidden kind, given its general lack of need for specialized training or innate supernatural abilities.

	Entropy is a THAUMATURGICAL concept, as well as a measurable MAGICAL property that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. The term and the concept are used in diverse fields, from classical NECROMANCY, where it was first recognized, to the microscopic description of nature in statistical HEX MAGIC, and to the principles of ARCANE theory. It has found far-ranging applications in ALCHEMY and SORCERY...

	The ancients, as their name implies, are people from long,

	Once upon a time, there was a burglar. The burglar wanted a rich man's treasure, so he invaded his home through a window. However, when he passed through it, he thought, 'is a door a window?' He remember that in ancient times, windows had doors, and giants were numerous, so...

	If someone cries, a more psychological approach assumes they're sad/distressed. In reality, we only make this assumption based on our own experience and what we're taught. We have no idea what their actual emotion is. And we can't know that.

	Why does one plus one equals two? You might think the answer is obvious, but consider the fact that this could've very well been false. What if items didn't stack, but instead morph together? Then one plus one would equal one. For you to understand thaumaturgy, shackles must be broken first.
